### Overview

The Python code defines two classes: `User` and `Users`. The `User` class encapsulates the attributes of an individual user, specifically their username and password. The `Users` class manages a collection of `User` instances, supporting operations like loading users from a file, user authentication, user registration and saving user data back to a file.

### Class `User`

#### Attributes:
- **username**: A string representing the user's unique identifier.
- **password**: A string representing the user's password for authentication purposes.

#### Methods:
- **`__init__(self, username, password)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Initializes a new instance of `User` with a username and password.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `username` (str): The username of the user.
    - `password` (str): The password of the user.
  - **Returns**: None.

- **`__str__(self)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Provides a string representation of the `User` instance, which is useful for debugging and logging.
  - **Returns**: A string that concatenates the username and password separated by a pipe (`|`).

So, how it works?

``` py
class User:
  pass

User()
```
An instance of a class is an object. A class is instantiated similarly to how a function is called, by placing the class name followed by parentheses. This creates a class object. To preserve it for further use, it is assigned to a variable, for example, user1.

``` py
user1 = User()
```
This is our first object (instance) of `class User` and it is some real person who wants to "Sign Up" or "Login".

``` py
user1.username = 'John'
user1.password = '123'
```
The second user can be:

``` py
user2.username = 'Alice'
user2.password = 'abc'
```

To avoid printing each object in the User class like this, we create what's called an initialization method as follows:

``` py
class User:
    def __init__(self, username, password):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
```

So, this "self" is related to a specific object, our real person or user (self => user1, user2 and so on)
This allows us to create objects in the following way:

``` py
user1 = User('John', '123')
user2 = User('Alice', 'abc')
```

The second method 

``` py
def __str__(self):
  return "{}|{}".format(self.username, self.password)
```

when you run the code, will print the "username" and "password" in the terminal in the following format:

``` bash
username|password
John|123
Alice|abc
```

In that way, you could check if your code works okay.



### Class `Users`

#### Attributes:
- **users_list**: A list that stores instances of `User`. This attribute acts as a database for registered users in the absence of a real database.

#### Methods:
- **`__init__(self)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Initializes the `Users` instance with an empty list of users.
  - **Returns**: None.

- **`load_users(self)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Loads user data from a text file named `users.txt`, creating `User` instances for each line in the file and adding them to `users_list`.
  - **Implementation Details**: Opens the file, reads each line, splits the line into username and password, and creates a `User` instance which is then appended to `users_list`.
  - **Returns**: None.
 
 > [!TIP]
 > Another way to write this method "load_users" is:

 ``` py
 def load_users(self):
        with open('users.txt', 'r') as file:
            lines = [line.strip() for line in file]
        for line in lines:
            r = line.split('|')
            user = User(r[0], r[1])
            self.users_list.append(user)
 ```

> [!NOTE]
> This part of code is "List comprehension" method

``` py
lines = [line.strip() for line in open('users.txt')]
```

For a detailed explanation of the list comprehensions used in this script, see [Detailed Explanation of List Comprehensions](List_comprehension.md).

- **`login(self, username, password)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Authenticates a user by checking if the username exists and if the password matches.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `username` (str): The username to authenticate.
    - `password` (str): The password to verify.
  - **Returns**: A string indicating whether the login was successful, the password was incorrect, or the user doesn't exist.

- **`sign_up(self, username, password)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Registers a new user, ensuring the username is not already taken.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `username` (str): The username for the new user.
    - `password` (str): The password for the new user.
  - **Returns**: A string indicating whether the account was created or if the username already exists.

- **`update_the_users(self)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Writes the current list of users to the `users.txt` file, updating it with any new or modified user information.
  - **Implementation Details**: Opens the file in write mode, writes each user's username and password to the file, separated by a pipe (`|`).
  - **Returns**: None.

### Explanation of Code Functionality

When the `Users` class is instantiated and `load_users()` is called, it populates the `users_list` from a file. This setup is typical in applications where user data needs to be persisted between sessions. The methods provided allow for basic user management operations such as logging in and registering which are fundamental features of many web applications.

Each function is equipped to handle common user interactions securely and effectively, storing user data in a simplistic format that is easy to read and update. This is crucial for understanding how user authentication and management are handled in many real-world applications, albeit in a more simplified form here without considerations for security features like password encryption.


### Class "Users" awaking (Instantiating)


After defining and setting up the `User` and `Users` classes, we proceed with utilizing these classes to manage user data effectively. The following code snippet demonstrates how to instantiate the `Users` class, load user data, and display each user:

``` py
U = Users()
U.load_users()
for user in U.users_list:
    print(user)
```

#### Explanation:

- **Instantiating `Users`**:
  - `U = Users()` creates an instance of the `Users` class. This instance is stored in the variable `U`. At this point, `U.users_list` is initialized as an empty list.

- **Loading Users**:
  - `U.load_users()` calls the `load_users` method of the `Users` class. This method is responsible for opening the 'users.txt' file, reading each line (where each line, except the first one, represents a user's data), and creating a `User` instance for each line. These instances are added to `U.users_list`.
  - The `load_users` method assumes that the data in 'users.txt' is formatted correctly, with each user's username and password separated by a pipe (`|`).

- **Displaying Each User**:
  - The `for user in U.users_list:` loop iterates over each `User` object in `U.users_list`.
  - `print(user)` invokes the `__str__` method of the `User` class to get a string representation of the `User` instance, which is then printed to the console. If the `__str__` method is implemented to return the username and password as `username|password`, that's what will be displayed for each user.

This section of the code effectively demonstrates how to handle multiple users using object-oriented programming in Python, making it easier to manage and manipulate user data programmatically.
