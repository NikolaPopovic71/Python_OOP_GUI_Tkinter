# Detailed Explanation of List Comprehensions

- List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
- The list comprehension used in the script:

``` py
lines = [line.strip() for line in open('users.txt')]
```

This line does the following:

- Opens the file `users.txt` for reading.
- Iterates over each line in the file.
- Applies the `.strip()` method to each line, which removes any leading and trailing whitespace, including the newline character `\n`.
- Collects the results into a new list named `lines`.

> [!TIP]
> Please, print(lines) in order to see how the list look likes

### Equivalent Code Without List Comprehension:

If you were to write the same functionality without using a list comprehension, it might look something like this:

``` py
lines = []
file = open('users.txt', 'r')  # Open the file in read mode
for line in file:
    stripped_line = line.strip()  # Strip whitespace from each line
    lines.append(stripped_line)  # Append the processed line to the list
file.close()  # It's important to close the file after you're done with it
```

### Key Differences:
- **Readability**: The list comprehension is more concise and often easier to read with simple expressions.
- **Automatic Handling of the Iterator**: In the list comprehension, the file is opened and handled line by line directly within the comprehension. However, it should be noted that this method doesn't explicitly close the file, which might lead to resource leaks. It's generally a good practice to manage file operations using `with` blocks (as shown below), which automatically handle file closing.
- **Explicit File Closing**: The non-comprehension version explicitly opens and closes the file, which is safer in terms of resource management but more verbose.
  
### Improved Non-Comprehension Version Using `with`:

For better resource management, you can use the `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes:

``` py
lines = []
with open('users.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        lines.append(line.strip())
```

This version uses a `with` statement to handle the file, ensuring that the file is closed once the block is exited, even if an error occurs within the block. This approach combines the clarity and safety of resource management in Python.
