## 1. Importing Libraries and Modules

``` py
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
from sign_up_login import *
```

- **`import tkinter as tk`**: Imports the Tkinter module and aliases it as tk. Tkinter is a standard GUI library for Python.
- **`from tkinter import messagebox`**: Imports the messagebox module from Tkinter, which provides standard dialog boxes to display messages.
- **`from sign_up_login import *`**: Imports everything from the sign_up_login module (or if we translate it into a common language from our Python file **sign_up_login.py**)

## 2. Setting Up the Main Window

``` py
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Sign Up")
root.geometry("350x250")
```

- **`root = tk.Tk()`**: Creates the main window for the application.
- **`root.title("Sign Up")`**: Sets the title of the window.
- **`root.geometry("350x250")`**: Sets the size of the window to 350 pixels wide by 250 pixels high.

## 3. Main Frame

``` py
main_frame = tk.Frame(root)
main_frame.pack(expand=True)
```

- **`main_frame = tk.Frame(root)`**: Creates a frame widget which will be the container for other widgets. It is placed inside the main window (root).
- **`main_frame.pack(expand=True)`**: Packs the frame into the window and allows it to expand if thereâ€™s extra space.

## 4. Sign Up Functionality

``` py
def create_account():
    ...
```

- `create_account()` defines the function to create a new user account. It opens a new top-level window (Toplevel) where users can enter a username and password.
- Inside this function, user inputs are collected, and the U.sign_up() method is called to attempt creating a new account. Feedback is provided via messagebox.

### Detailed about function `create_account()`

##### Function Definition

``` py
def create_account():
```

This line starts the definition of the create_account function, which does not take any arguments.

##### Creating a Pop-up Window

``` py
    t2 = tk.Toplevel(main_frame)
    t2.geometry("300x200")  # Size the Toplevel window
```

- **`t2 = tk.Toplevel(main_frame)`**: This creates a new window (Toplevel) which is a child of main_frame. This window will serve as the interface for user input required for signing up.
- **`t2.geometry("300x200")`**: Sets the size of the pop-up window to 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.

##### Username Input

``` py
    tk.Label(t2, text="Username").pack()
    t2_entry_username = tk.Entry(t2)
    t2_entry_username.pack()
```

- **`tk.Label(t2, text="Username").pack()`**: Places a label in the pop-up window (t2) with the text "Username". The pack() method is used to add the label to the window.
- **`t2_entry_username = tk.Entry(t2)`**: Creates an entry widget for the username input, placed inside the t2 window.
- **`t2_entry_username.pack()`**: Adds the username entry widget to the window layout.

##### Password Input

``` py
    tk.Label(t2, text="Password").pack()
    t2_entry_password = tk.Entry(t2, show="*")
    t2_entry_password.pack()
```

- **`tk.Label(t2, text="Password").pack()`**: Similar to the username label, this line adds a "Password" label to the window.
- **`t2_entry_password = tk.Entry(t2, show="*")`**: Creates an entry widget for the password. The `show="*"` argument masks the text input, showing asterisks (*) instead of the characters typed.
- **`t2_entry_password.pack()`**: Adds the password entry widget to the window layout.

##### Create Button and Its Command

``` py
    t2_create_button = tk.Button(t2, text="Create", command=lambda: (
        messagebox.showinfo("Sign Up Result", result := U.sign_up(t2_entry_username.get(), t2_entry_password.get())),
        t2.destroy() if result == "Account successfully created" else (
            t2_entry_username.delete(0, tk.END),
            t2_entry_password.delete(0, tk.END),
            t2_entry_username.focus()
        )
    ))
    t2_create_button.pack()
```

- **`tk.Button(t2, text="Create", command=lambda: ...)`**: Adds a "Create" button that, when clicked, triggers the embedded command defined by the lambda function.
  - **The lambda function** first attempts to sign up a new user by calling U.sign_up() with the entered username and password as arguments. The result of this operation (success or failure message) is stored in the variable result.
  - **`messagebox.showinfo(...)`**: Displays a message box with the result of the sign-up attempt.
  - **The if statement** checks if the account creation was successful:
    - **If successful** (result == "Account successfully created"), the pop-up window (t2) is destroyed, closing it.
    - **If unsuccessful**, the username and password fields are cleared (delete(0, tk.END)), and focus is returned to the username entry field (t2_entry_username.focus()).
- **`t2_create_button.pack()`**: Adds the button to the window layout.
  
This function manages the entire process of user registration from input collection to feedback, ensuring a clear and interactive user experience. It neatly encapsulates the sign-up process in a separate window, making the main application window less cluttered.

> [!NOTE]
> - The lambda function now performs both the operation of showing the message box and conditionally closing the window. This is done using the **`walrus operator (:=)`**, which is available from Python 3.8 onwards. It allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of a larger expression.
> - For the account creation in the create_account function, the lambda captures the result of the sign_up function, shows the result in a message box, and checks if the result indicates a successful account creation to close the t2 window.

> [!TIP]
> your editor (for example VSCode) might write with red letters the following messages:
> - "destroy" of "Tk" does not return a value;
> - "delete" of "Entry" does not return a value
> The code works, but what happens? Please, see here [Detailed why not lambda and walrus](Detailed_lambda_function_walrus.md)

## 5. Welcome and Instruction Messages

``` py
welcome_label = tk.Label(...)
instructions_label = tk.Label(...)
```

- Labels are added to the main_frame to display a welcome message and instructions for users.

## 6. Login Interface

``` py
login_frame = tk.Frame(main_frame)
...
username_label = tk.Label(login_frame, text="Username:")
entry_username = tk.Entry(login_frame)
password_label = tk.Label(login_frame, text="Password:")
entry_password = tk.Entry(login_frame, show="*")
...
```

- A subframe (login_frame) and associated labels and entry widgets are created for username and password input. The password entry widget uses show="*" to hide the password characters.

## 7. Action Buttons

``` py
login_button = tk.Button(...)
sign_up_button = tk.Button(...)
```

- Buttons for logging in and signing up are created. The `Login` button checks credentials using U.login() and provides appropriate feedback. The `Sign Up` button opens the account creation window.

## 8. Starting the GUI

``` py
root.mainloop()
```

- This is the event loop that waits for events (like button clicks) and updates the GUI accordingly.
